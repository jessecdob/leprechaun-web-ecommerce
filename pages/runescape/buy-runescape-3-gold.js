                            Runescape 3 is a popular MMORPG and have existed for over two decades. Runescape 3 gold is the
                            currency that people are able to gain when playing the game. Runescape 3 enables you to
                            train your skills more efficiently and achieve more higher tier items. Spirit Shards can also be 
                            as the currency. Each Spirit shard is worth 25gp and it can be exchanged using the Taverely Summoner's
                            guide. www.runescape.com is the game's offical website. Runescape is a different game mode from Old School
                            Runescape but they are both created by Jagex LTD. Runescape 3 is sometimes referred to EOC or Evolution 
                            of combat gold because E.O.C was the change in gamemodes between Runescape and Runescape 3 back in 2014.
                            Many people quit Runescape because they changed the gamemode to E.O.C style combat system.
